### **SkillSwap: Peer-to-Peer Skill Sharing with AI**

### **The Issue You're Solving**

In today's interconnected world, access to learning and skill development is often hindered by financial barriers or lack of resources. Many people possess valuable skills but lack opportunities to learn or trade them with others. This leads to untapped potential and an inefficient exchange of knowledge.

*SkillSwap* addresses this problem by creating a platform where individuals can exchange skills directly, bypassing financial constraints. For example, a graphic designer can teach design skills to a programmer, who in turn provides coding lessons, fostering a community-driven ecosystem of learning and collaboration.

### **Your Submitted Software and Its Functionality**

*SkillSwap* is a web-based platform with the following features:

1. **Skill Profiles**: Users create profiles listing their offered skills and skills they wish to learn. They can also include availability and preferences.
2. **AI-Powered Matching**: An AI algorithm (powered by OpenAI’s API) uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze skill descriptions and match users based on compatibility, preferences, and availability.
3. **Gamification and Karma Points**: Users earn “karma points” for sharing their skills or helping others. These points can be redeemed for additional learning opportunities or featured placements on the platform.
4. **Skill Progress Tracking**: The platform tracks users' progress using self-assessments, peer feedback, and optional goal-setting.
5. **Communication Tools**: Integrated chat and video features allow seamless interaction for lessons or collaborations.
6. **Leaderboard and Community Features**: A leaderboard motivates users by showcasing the top contributors, fostering engagement and healthy competition.
